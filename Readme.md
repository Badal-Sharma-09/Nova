## As of May 30, 2022, Google has discontinued the "Less Secure Apps" feature, which previously allowed applications to connect using just a username and password. Now, if your account has 2-Step Verification enabled, you need to create an App Password to allow less secure apps or devices to access your Google Account. ‚Äã

Solution: Generating an App Password

To resolve this issue, follow these steps to generate an App Password for your application:

## Enable 2-Step Verification:

Go to your Google Account Security Settings.‚Äã

Find the "Signing in to Google" section.‚Äã
Gist

Click on "2-Step Verification" and follow the prompts to enable it.‚Äã

Create an App Password:

After enabling 2-Step Verification, return to the "Security" section.‚Äã

Click on "App Passwords."‚Äã

You might be prompted to sign in again.‚Äã

In the "Select app" dropdown, choose "Other (Custom name)" and enter a name that helps you remember the purpose (e.g., "FlaskApp").‚Äã

Click "Generate."‚Äã
Medium

A 16-character password will appear. Note this down securely; this is the password your application will use.‚Äã
